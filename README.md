# Email-Verficiation-PHP
Hi folks, In this project I've created a email verification system. It takes email and password during the time of register from the user and verify user's email by sending a mail to his/her inbox with a verification code. If the code entered by user is correct, then the email will get verified, otherwise it will not verify. A simulation of how email verification works on the site nowadays.

# How to configure xampp to send email (Windows)
In order to send mails from localhost, I've seen many users are finding it difficult to work, so here is a quick guide on how to send email from your localhost step-by-step.
 # Setup Gmail
   1. Login to your gmail account in a browser from which you want to send emails.
   2. Go to **www.google.com**, you should see yourself logged in to your gmail.
   3. Click on your google profile logo on top-right corner of the window.
   4. Click on **Manage your Google Account**
   5. Now, you will see various options, go to _Security_.
   6. Enable _2-Step Verification_ on your account.
   7. Once you've enabled 2-Step Verification, Copy **https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords** and paste in your browser.
   8. It will ask you to login, login with your gmail password.
   9. Now under **Select the app and device for which you want to generate the app password.** click on _Select app_.
   10. Choose **Other (_Custom name_)** and enter any name of your choise, In my case it is _localhost sendmail_.
   11. Click on **GENERATE** button, a dailogue-box will appear which will provide you the **Generated app password**.
   12. Copy the generated password, the password should look like this **_vbre zvrw obfs jeaj_**, now copy this password and note it down somewhere as it will not be available again.
